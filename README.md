Personal academic website.

## About

This repository contains the source for my research homepage.

My work focuses on formal modelling of complex systems under uncertainty — particularly where causality, time, and structural constraints shape what can be inferred and what actions remain feasible.

Recent themes include:

- Interval-based representations of event time and temporal coherence
- Feasibility-set modelling under coordination latency
- Threshold exclusion and non-compensability in complex systems
- Causal structure and effective connectivity
- Testable design hypotheses for coordination mechanisms

## Structure

- `index.html` — homepage
- `notes.html` — short research notes
- `style.css` — minimal, serif-based theme (dark/light toggle)
- `CNAME` — custom domain configuration (if applicable)

## Notes

The site is intentionally simple: no frameworks, no build system, no dependencies.

It is designed to be:

- Fast
- Legible
- Durable
- Low ceremony

All writing is a work in progress.
